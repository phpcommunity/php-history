title: GoPHP 5 Project

date: '2007-07'

  In 2007, PHP 5 had been out for three years but still had paltry usage compared to PHP 4.
  That was mainly due to a chicken-and-egg issue, where shared hosts (which was most of the market at the time)
  didn't want to update to PHP 5 until their customers required it, but major PHP projects
  didn't want to require PHP 5 until enough hosts supported it.  No project wanted to be the
  first to move, and possibly lose marketshare.
  
  In July of 2007, Larry Garfield launched the GoPHP 5 Project, in collaboration
  with Robert Douglass, Marc Delisle, and others.  Its goal was to collect projects and hosts
  willing to commit to switching to PHP 5.2 as of 5 February the following year.  (5.2.2008, in European dating.)
  With a large number of projects moving at once, no one would have a "first mover disadvantage."
  Additionally, the hosts would demonstrate that PHP 5 availability was no longer an issue.
  
  Officially announced with 6 projects and 3 hosts on 5 July 2007, by the end of the month
  over 100 projects and 200 hosts had signed on.  The PHP Project itself also decided during
  that time to announce an End-of-Life for PHP 4.  In effect, GoPHP 5 assassinated PHP 4,
  and cleared the way for the next era of PHP's growth.
  
  GoPHP 5 was also the first major cross-project collaboration in PHP's history.

    and is now a spam page.  See the Archive.org copy listed below.
