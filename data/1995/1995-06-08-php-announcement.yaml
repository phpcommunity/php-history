title: PHP Tools Announcement
date: 1995-06-08

description: >
  Rasmus Lerdorf announces "a set of small tight cgi binaries written in C" that
  allow users to do things like "log access to your pages," view logs, build
  access counters, ban "access to users based on their domain," "create and
  display forms," and much more, all without requiring "root access,"
  "server-side includes enabled," "access to Perl or Tcl," or "access to the
  httpd log files."
