  The April 1996 meeting of the Linux Users Group of Rochester (LUGOR) featured
  a presentation from Thomas Bullinger on PHP/FI. The meeting announcement
  describes PHP:

  > PHP/FI is a server-side html-embedded scripting language. It lets you write
  > simple scripts right in your .HTML files much like JavaScript does, except,
  > unlike JavaScript PHP/FI is not browser-dependant. If you like free fast-moving
  > software that comes with full source code you will probably like PHP/FI.

notes: |
  This might be the first user group meeting with a presentation on PHP.
