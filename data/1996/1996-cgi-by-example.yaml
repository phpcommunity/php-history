  *CGI by Example* includes a chapter titled "Using PHP/FI." It describes PHP:

  > PHP/FI was developed by Rasmus Lerdorf, who needed to create a script that
  > enabled him to log visitors to his page. The script replaced a few other
  > smaller ones that were creating a load on Lerdorf's system. This script
  > became PHP, which is an acronym for Rasmus' Personal Home Page tools. Later
  > Lerdorf wrote a script that enabled him to embed commands within an HTML
  > document to access a SQL database. This script acted as a forms interpreter
  > (hence the name *FI*), which made it easier to create forms using a database.
  > These two scripts have since been combined into one complete package called
  > PHP/FI.

notes: >
  It's possible this is the first published book to mention PHP.
