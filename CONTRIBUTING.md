## Fixing Bugs and Inaccurate Information

This project welcomes pull requests to fix bugs and inaccurate information!

If you see a bug report that you'd like to fix, please feel free to do so.
Following the directions and guidelines described in the "Adding New Features"
section below, you may create bugfix branches and send pull requests.

## Adding New Features and Information

If you have an idea for a new feature or data, it's a good idea to check out the
[issues][] or active [pull requests][] first to see if anyone is already working
on it. If not, feel free to submit an issue first, asking whether the feature
or data is beneficial to the project. This will save you from doing a lot of
development work only to have your pull request rejected. We don't enjoy
rejecting your hard work, but some features don't fit with the goals of the
project.

When you do begin working on your feature, here are some guidelines to consider:

* Your pull request description should clearly detail the changes you have made.
* If adding new data to the `data/` directory, please use `data-template.yaml`
  and follow the directions in it.
* **Use topic/feature branches.** Please do not ask to pull from your main branch.
  * For more information, see "[Understanding the GitHub flow][gh-flow]."
* **Submit one feature or data per pull request.** If you have multiple features
  or data you wish to submit, please break them into separate pull requests.
