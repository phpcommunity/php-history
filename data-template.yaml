# Please use this template when creating a PHP history event.
#
# Events may be any number of things that took place at a specified time,
# including software releases, conferences, user group meetings, books and
# magazines published, RFC discussions, RFC vote closings, and much more. In
# short, if something significant happened, and you can attach a date to it,
# it's an event.
#
# Before opening a pull request for an event, please remove these template
# comments and any non-required properties not relevant to the event.
#
# Feel free to add any new data properties you think are missing and are
# necessary to convey all the necessary information about the event.
#
# Please name the file according to the event's `date` or `start_date`
# property, being as specific as possible with the date-time. Include a
# trailing short "slug" of the event title to help prevent file name conflicts.
# Use only alphanumeric characters and dashes, and be sure the time is in UTC
# (see notes on event dates below). Place the file in a subdirectory named for
# the year the event occurred.
#
#   data/YYYY/YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS-event-name-slug.yaml
#
# For example:
#
#   data/2025/2025-01-24-00-00-phpxmsp.yaml
#   data/2025/2025-05-20-phptek.yaml
#
# Note: the above example uses "00-00" for the hour and minute when the PHPxMSP
# user group meeting started. This is because 6pm America/Chicago time on
# January 23, 2025, is 00:00 UTC on January 24, 2025.

# Event title (required)
title: A short description or name of the event

# Event date(s)
# (either date is required or both start_date and end_date are required)
#
# If the event is a point-in-time event, use `date` to specify a single
# date-time for the event. If the event is a duration-based event, use
# `start_date` and `end_date` to specify the starting and ending date-time
# values for the event.
#
# Use ISO 8601 format to specify dates and times.
#
# You may use reduced precision (i.e., year, year and month, etc.) to specify
# dates for events that do not have a specific day or time (e.g., publication
# dates, etc.).
#
# Please specify all times in UTC (i.e., `Z` or `+00:00`).
#
# Since time zone offsets for any given time in history aren't equal (e.g.,
# March 28, 2005, in Chicago, US, does not have the same time zone offset from
# UTC as March 28, 2007, in Chicago, US), use a script like this one to figure
# out what time in UTC should be for your event: https://3v4l.org/imsEU
#
# Here are some example formats for dates:
#
#     YYYY
#     YYYY-MM
#     YYYY-MM-DD
#     YYYY-MM-DDThhZ
#     YYYY-MM-DDThh:mmZ
#     YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ
#
date: 'YYYY-MM-DD'
#start_date: 'YYYY-MM-DDThh:mmZ'
#end_date: 'YYYY-MM-DDThh:mmZ'

# Location of the event (optional)
location: Venue Name, City, Country

# Description (optional)
#
# Provide a description of the event, explaining its significance in the history
# of the PHP programming language and community. You may use Markdown, and to
# use the right YAML syntax for multiline strings, check out
# https://yaml-multiline.info.

# Tags (optional)
#
# As the amount of history data increases, tags can help us better organize and
# make sense of the data. You may use as many tags as you like, but try to keep
# them simple and generic. If you do use a specific tag for an event (e.g.,
# "phptek"), that can be helpful to find all events related to the php[tek]
# conference. However, it would be helpful to also include the tag
# "conference," in this example. Some past events that have occurred at a
# php[tek] conference include things like meetings of user group organizers, so
# you might tag these events with "phptek" and "user-group," for example.
#
# Please don't include years, version numbers, or similar variants in tag names.
tags:
  - tag1
  - tag2
  - tag3

# One or more sources provided as evidences for the event (required)
#
# You must cite at least one source!
sources:
  - # Be sure each source is an object in a YAML array.
    
    # The title of the cited source. This might be the title of a blog post,
    # web page, newspaper article, magazine article, book chapter, book,
    # mailing list subject line, etc.
    title: An Article About The Event

    # List the names of each author credited on the source.
    authors:
      - Janet Smith
      - John Doe

    # If a source has an editor (or editors) credited, list their names.
    # For example, this might be the case if you're citing a chapter from a book
    # of essays, such as O'Reilly's 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know.
    editors:
      - Maria Gonz√°lez

    # The publication date of the source, not necessarily the event date.
    date: 'YYYY-MM-DD'

    # Use a word or phrase that describes the medium (i.e., blog, website,
    # mailing list, forum, podcast, newspaper, magazine, journal, book,
    # presentation, conference keynote, photograph, report, etc.).
    medium: blog

    # Many sources are contained within a larger work, and it's useful to
    # know the name of that larger work (i.e., the container). If that's the
    # case with your source, include the name of the container here.
    #
    # For example, if the source is a
    # - web page, use the name of the website.
    # - blog post, use the name of the blog.
    # - mailing list post, use the name of the mailing list.
    # - magazine article, use the name of the magazine.
    # - newspaper article, use the name of the newspaper.
    # - journal article, use the name of the journal.
    # - conference presentation, use the name of the conference.
    # - chapter of a book, use the name of the book.
    # - book, omit this; there's no container.
    container: My Awesome Blog

    # Magazines, books, journals, and other mediums might have a publisher
    # listed that is separate from the name of the container.
    publisher: Random Casa

    # Some containers will list a location, like books or conferences.
    # If your source lists one, include it here.
    location: Indianapolis

    url: https://example.com/an-article-about-the-event

    # Some publications use a digital object identifier (DOI).
    # If your source includes one, list it here.
    doi: '10.1109/SECON.2000.845625'

    # Books, journals, and magazines often use page numbers. If your source is
    # from a specific subset of pages from one of these mediums, list the page
    # numbers here, if you know them.
    pages: '337-357'
